# What if fortune cookies were filled with movie plots?

You've probably wondered that many times. Or maybe you haven't - that's fine too.

This repo is a project currently in progress to create some sort of application using spaCy to transform brief movie synopses into fortune cookie statements and, hopefully, a web app that will be fun to use.

Thanks for visiting!

* created a basic app using Dash (hompage with click-for-random, quiz page, about page)

* added a requirements.txt file

* added a test_cases.json file

* added "if name..." boilerplate to fortune_cookie.py so it didn't trigger on import to dash app

* moved fortune_cookie.py and test_cases.py so they could be imported into the app (otherwise above top-level imports)
